# Negative Binomial Distribution
There is a patient with less rare disease. The probability is P(disease) = 0.05. By given the 10000 patients we want to check the probability for 150 patients with negative binomial distribution.
```{r}
choose(10000+150-1, 10000)*(0.05^10000)*(0.95^150)
```
According to the result shown above, the result for choose function is infinity. Therefore we cannot get the exact probability for this problem in R.


# Geometric Distribution
In this problem, we want to know the probability of interviewing 20 records until the first patient with disease be found.

```{r}
(0.05)*(0.95)^20

```
According to result shown above, we can know that the probability for 
interviewing 20 records and finding the first patient with disease is 0.018.
